## Hi, it’s me~ (*・ω・)ﾉ

People call me **Dyrochka**, and I write programs that sometimes actually work (￣▽￣)

### What I love / what I’m learning
- **Rust** 🦀  
- **Go** (Golang) 🐹  
- **Helix** (Modal edition)  
- Infrastructure stuff and everything around it:  
  **Docker** ・ **Kubernetes** ・ **PostgreSQL** ・ **Linux** in general

### Things I really want to try but I’m scared / no time
- **Nix** — because there’s never enough time (´；ω；`)  
- **Lisp** — because I’m genuinely scared to touch it… it’s too beautiful and too weird (´⊙ω⊙`)

### Who I am at heart
Lain Lover ♡  
Lain is a living program, and I’m a programmer.  
Feels like fate to me (´｡• ω •｡`) ♡

### Random fun fact
C has such weak typing that you can just casually do arithmetic with `char` and `int` and the compiler won’t even complain ( ౦ ‸ ౦ )

In short: I’m the kind of person who wants to write reliable and beautiful code, but sometimes gets scared of documentation and hugs LLMs when everything becomes too overwhelming (*ﾉωﾉ)
